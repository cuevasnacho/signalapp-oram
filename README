## Tree path
Tree path implementation seems to be completed. All tests pass

Some considerations:
- As in Jasmin is not possible to allocate memory dynamically, the size of the `tree_path` has to be fixed in the parameters.

Tested functions:
- `tree_path_update`
- `level`
- `node_val`
- `tree_path_num_nodes`
- `tree_path_lower_bound`
- `tree_path_upper_bound`
- `tree_path_level`

## Bucket
Current implementation use the same structure as in C (take into account both parameters when reading from memory).

Tested functions:
- `bucket_store_clear`
- `bucket_store_read_bucket_blocks`
- `bucket_store_write_bucket_blocks`

## Stash
Code is compiling but there are some functions that haven't been tested and they are a bit complex.

Tested functions:
- `stash_add_path_bucket`: something is happening with this function. If the whole test suite is executed then it will fail, otherwise it passes all tests.
- `stash_scan_overflow_for_target`
  - `stash_overflow_ub`
  - `first_block_in_bucket_for_level`
  - `cond_swap_blocks`
  - `cond_copy_block`
    - `cond_obv_copy_u64`
    - `cond_obv_swap_u64` not oblivious yet

## Test Suite
> **Note:**
> Remember to change `PATH_LENGTH` parameter in `params.jinc` to correctly run the test suite.

## Wish list
- Change `#CMOVcc` instructions
